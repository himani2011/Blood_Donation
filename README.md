# Blood_Donation

This is a website made up using MERN stack development concepts and technology. 

It takes state, city and intended blood group as inputs from user and as soon as the user clicks on 'Search donors' button, the list of all donors (who signed up on this website before) is shown. By seeing 
the donors' contact information, the person in need can contact the donor and get the blood in time. This greatly helps the persons in need when the hospitals don't have enough blood with them. 

Future enhancements: 
These are not exactly future enhancements, but I am working on them right now:
1. Profile page where donors can turn on/off their availability of donating blood.
2. Showing the list of organizations
